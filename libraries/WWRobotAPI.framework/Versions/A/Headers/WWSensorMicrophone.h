/**
 *  The `WWSensorMicrophone` object provides detected sound data from `WWRobot` (read-only).  
 *
 *  `WWRobot` will try to detect sound from a two-dimensional plane and returns the calculated 
 *  amplitude.  If sound is loud enough, `WWRobot` will also triangulate the direction where the 
 *  sound is coming from and return it as triangulationAngle in radians.
